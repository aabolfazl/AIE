## What I'm Doing Now
The [Now page](https://nownownow.com/about) is a concept by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/). It's a simple way to share what you're currently focused on in life.
I think it's a great idea to keep track of my current activities and interests with my readers, maybe it can inspire someone or spark a conversation.

Here’s what I’m working on lately:

### Projects
- [Vortex](https://github.com/aabolfazl/Vortex): An L4 load balancer written in C++ using io_uring.
- [KDHT](https://github.com/aabolfazl/kdht): A key-value store using the Kademlia distributed hash table written in Rust.
- [io-uring-lab](https://github.com/aabolfazl/io-uring-lab) : A collection of examples and experiments with io_uring.
- Researching about an Layer 3 load balancer with eBPF, Go and C.

### Papers
I’m diving into this paper for inspiration and learning:
- [Kademlia: A Peer-to-Peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf).

### Books
I don't have much time for reading books, but I'm trying to read books that are related to my projects and interests. my readiing method is to read a book in a long period of time, and read it multiple times to understand it deeply. for exanple I raed the "The linux programming interface" book once to get a general idea of the book, and now using it as a reference book when I need to know something about Linux programming. this makes me to read the book multiple times and understand it more deeply.

- [The Linux Programming Interface](https://man7.org/tlpi/): A comprehensive guide to system programming on Linux.
- [Fluent C priceples and practices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-c/9781492052879/): A book about writing clean and efficient C code.
- [Rust Programming By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rust-programming-by-example/9781801073443): A book about learning Rust by examples.
- [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition): A book about writing concurrent and parallel programs in C++.
- [Computer Networking, A Top Down Approach, 7th, converted](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/computer-networking-a-top-down-approach-7th-edition/P100000879978): A book about computer networking.
- [Linux Kernel Networking Implementation and Theory](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484220075): Linux networking stack internal and implementation details.
- [Understanding Distributed Systems Roberto Vitillo](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-distributed-systems/9781492040333/): What every developer should know about distributed systems.

### Learning

Studying about distributed systems and DHTs, and diving into Linux Networking internals.
Mentoring 2 student for leraning C and Systems Programming.
Studying about Rust Programming Language.
Researching about eBPF and XDP.
