Here’s what I’m working on lately:

### Projects
- [Vortex](https://github.com/aabolfazl/Vortex): An L4 load balancer written in C++ using io_uring.
- [KDHT](https://github.com/aabolfazl/kdht): A key-value store using the Kademlia distributed hash table written in Rust.
- Researching about an Layer 3 load balancer with eBPF, Go and C.

### Papers
I’m diving into this paper for inspiration and learning:
- [Kademlia: A Peer-to-Peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf).

### Learning

Studying about distributed systems and DHTs, and diving into Linux Networking internals.
Mentoring 2 student for leraning C and Systems Programming.
