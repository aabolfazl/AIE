## Introduction

# DHT Kernelspace Routing(C) and Userspace Storage(Rust)

## Introduction

This project implements a **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** using a split architecture: **routing logic** in the kernel space and **storage functionality** in the userspace. This design allows efficient packet routing directly in the kernel while leveraging Rust in userspace for safe, flexible data management.

## Concept

Using a **Kademlia-based DHT**, the kernel module manages node discovery, routing, and packet forwarding based on an XOR distance metric, allowing efficient data lookup across distributed nodes. The kernel handles the DHTâ€™s routing independently, guiding requests through the network to locate data on other nodes when necessary.

If a request arrives for data stored locally, the kernel module calls on a Rust-based userspace application to manage the data storage and retrieval. This separation allows clients to seamlessly locate data within the DHT without implementing their own DHT logic.

## Key Components

1. **Kernel space (Routing)**: The kernel module intercepts packets, manages the DHT routing table, and uses XOR-based lookups to route requests across the network.
2. **Userspace (Storage)**: The Rust application in userspace handles data storage for locally-responsible keys, supporting the kernel's routing layer without interfering with routing logic.

## Benefits

- **High Performance**: Kernel-level routing minimizes latency in DHT lookups.
- **Modularity**: Decoupling routing and storage allows each layer to scale or improve independently.
- **Safety**: Rust in userspace ensures safe, concurrent data handling for reliable storage management.

This project provides a robust, modular DHT implementation with efficient routing and safe, manageable storage, suited for distributed data access without centralization.

# Roadmap for Implementing
This project will start with a full userspace implementation to establish and test core functionality. Once stable, the routing component will be transitioned to the kernel for improved performance.

### Phase 1: Userspace Implementation
- **Routing Module:** Implement Rust's core DHT routing logic, including node communication and efficient key-based lookups.
- **Storage Module:** Build a storage layer to manage data, integrated with the routing module.

### Phase 2: Kernel Transition for Routing
- **Kernel Routing Module:** Move the routing logic to a Linux kernel module, allowing for low-latency packet handling.
- **Kernel-Userspace Integration:** Connect the kernel routing module with the userspace storage layer to complete a hybrid DHT system.

Stay tuned for upcoming posts where I'll share my learning journey and dive into specific implementation details. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/aabolfazl/kdht).
